#+title: BambooHR (BHR)

A simple package to improve the use of Bamboo HR, since it lacks the ability to
cleanly submit multiple entries.

* Setup
To greatly simplify, the authentication for the package is handled via authinfo.
To add a new set of credentials, create/modify your desired autoinfo file
(=$HOME/.authinfo= or ideally =$HOME/.authinfo.gpg=) to include an entry similar to
below:

#+begin_src authinfo
machine mysite.bamboohr.com login my@email.address password supersecretpass123
#+end_src

And ensure that =bhr-org-name= matches the machine name (in the above example; set the variable to =mysite=).

* Usage
** =bhr-view-timesheet=
Prompt for a date and display the relevant timesheet for that date.

[[file:.github/assets/view-timesheet.png]]

[[file:.github/assets/timesheet-entry.png]]

The total amount of hours tracked for each day is displayed next to it, with the
value of =bhr-default-hours= being used as the maximal amount.

When in the timesheet view, you can delete entries by selecting the one(s) you
wish to delete with =d= and executing the list of actions with =x=. After
confirming, the entries will be removed from both the list view /and Bamboo
itself/ (this is obviously a destructive action).

Edit support is Coming Soon ™️.

** =bhr-submit-multiple=
Prompt for a task, a date range, the hours and an optional note and produce the
relevant entries on Bamboo.

The date range inputs also accept any org shorthand, for example =+2d= for 2 days
from _today_ and =++2d= for 2 days _from the start date_.
